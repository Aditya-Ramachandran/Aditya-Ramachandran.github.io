      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a software engineer.</p>
      <p>
        My experience includes diving into machine learning and backend development, where I've learned about data analysis, training models, and deploying solutions to solve real-world problems. While I'm still fascinated by the possibilities of AI and ML, I'm currently focusing more on backend development. <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        In my backend development journey, I enjoy crafting solutions that are scalable, easy to maintain, and perform well. Whether it's designing APIs or optimizing databases, I love the challenge of building the foundation for applications and services.
        <br> <br>
        My toolbox includes languages like Python, Java, as well as frameworks such as Flask and Spring Boot and a myriad of Machine Learnig Libraries (well, its a long list). I'm also familiar with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.
      </p>

      <p>
        I frequently indulge in watching captivating YouTube content, with channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague">Sebastian Lague</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet">Code Bullet</a> being among my favorites. These videos not only entertain but also serve as a wellspring of inspiration. <br>While, I am no expert, I have a generalist, first-principle view towards complex problems. 
      </p>

      <p>
      When I'm not busy with tech stuff, I enjoy taking photos as a hobby. Here are three of my favorite pictures that I've managed to capture (and the good ones I could find from the bunch of photos I have lol)

      <p>
        I'm always eager to learn and grow, whether it's exploring new technologies or collaborating with others on exciting projects. If you're interested in learning together or have ideas to share, feel free to reach out!
      <br />The best way to reach out to me would be via email.

            <b><a href="https://github.com/Aditya-Ramachandran/SiesmoStream">SiesmoStream</a>:</b>
            I built this web-app to make exploring earthquake data fun and interactive. Easily plot earthquakes on a map and discover patterns over time. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, it's perfect for learning more about earthquakes and their impact. Give it a try and uncover something fascinating about our planet!

            <b><a href="https://github.com/Aditya-Ramachandran/cardiovascular-disease-detection">Cardiovascular Disease Detection using Ensemble Learning</a>:</b>
            A university project where the primary aim was to detect cardiovascular disease (CVD) early, effectively managing its progression and enhancing patient well-being. To improve accuracy in diagnosis, we proposed an ensemble model integrating machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. This approach combines the strengths of each algorithm to enhance prediction outcomes for CVD detection and management.

            This serves as a collection of my Kaggle notebooks, showcasing various data analysis projects and explorations. You can find a wide range of topics covered, including data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and more.

        </ol>
        <h2>Miscellaneous Things</h2>
        <p>
          While in university, I co-authored a conference paper in IEEE as part of my work on cardiovascular disease detection in healthcare:
          <ol>
              <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398045">
                Early Cardiovascular Disease Detection Using Ensemble Methods</a><br/>
          </ol>
        </p>


        </p>A lot of my university time was spent getting my hands dirty and tinkering around machine learning systems. This led to achieving Kaggle Expert status in datasets, discussions, and notebooks, placing me in the top 7% of users across all sections on Kaggle.  
        <br>
        <br>
        I like writing too. I occasionally do write tech blogs on medium. (Although it's been a while since my last post, I'm eager to resume writing soon).
